Enhanced User Interface DLC Version 1.25c (January 27th 2015)

--------
OVERVIEW
--------

1.	make the game more convenient to use: fewer clicks, more icons, information organized more efficiently
2.	make it easier to understand the interactions of game objects: more mouseover actions and tooltips, use game XML data - not hardcoded blurbs
3.	no changes to gameplay, no effect on game saves, can earn achievements, works in multiplayer, and no additional information that is not already available somewhere

-------------------
CHANGES VS ORIGINAL
-------------------

(January 28th, 2013)
Gift Unit to city-state from leaderpanel, appears while having Arsonal of Democracy. (custom gift icon needed)

Purchase landsknecht from banner, second click selects the landsknecht in the city, so doubleclick for best effect. (A single click ATM cannot happen because city:PurchaseUnit(..) returns before the unit is purchased and offers no callback, *shame firaxis hire better devs*, so calling selectUnit right after fails, hence the need to doubleclick. Custom landsknecht icon needed)

Removed "Are you sure?" popup for gifting a unit, and building over an improvement.
Removed recommended worker suggestions. (useless because often the game will recommend building a road when your standing on an unimproved luxury, and if you misclick you will waste a turn)

Ignore all trade requests from AI. 50% complete (Cannot figure out how to prevent the leaderscreen for poping up for a split second). AI often requests to trade with you when you can see what they have anyways. Significantly slowing down turn times.

Show tradeable Luxuries/Strategics even with only 1 copy for yourself.

TODO:
Trade/Loan gold and Trade lux/strategics from the leader panel (50% complete, Leader UI popup cannot be avoided atm, leader panel icon menu is messed up and TextButtons break / get click throughed)


----------------------
INSTRUCTIONS FOR LINUX
----------------------

1.Basically copy the ui_bc1 folder into your civ5 assets/dlc folder.

chown -R steamuser:steamuser ui_bc1
chmod -R 755 ui_bc1

restart steam + civ5 completely.

INSTRUCTIONS
------------

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ud_wH4Q8W9I
1.	make sure your game is up to date at version 1.0.3.144 or later (EUI DLC is incompatible with older game versions)
2.	exit the game (make sure Civ V is NOT running)
3.	download the file from http://forums.civfanatics.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=21929
4.	open the game's DLC folder:
	- on a PC usually it's C:\Steam\SteamApps\common\sid meier's civilization v\assets\DLC (replace C: by whatever drive and/or directory where Steam is installed)
	- on a MAC (thanks AlanH) it's in the Civ5 application package at Civilization V.app/Contents/Home/assets/DLC
		You have to right click the app icon and select Show package contents. The application package location is EITHER:
		in case of MAC Steam installation: /Users/<user_name>/Library/Application Support/Steam/SteamApps/common/Sid Meier's Civilization V/Civilization V.app
		OR
		in case of MAC AppStore installation: /Applications/Civilization V Campaign Edition.app
5.	remove any previous version of EUI DLC (delete the entire UI_bc1 folder if one already exists, don't just overwrite)
6.	extract from the downloaded zip and copy the UI_bc1 folder to the game's DLC folder. ONLY if your OS is Linux, all of these files / folders must be renamed to lower case equivalent ( find ui_bc1 -depth -exec rename 's/(.*)\/([^\/]*)/$1\/\L$2/' {} \; )
7.	EUI DLC is modular: if there are things you don't like or need or which conflict with mods you want to use (check the known "mods compatibility" list at http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?p=12847246), you can disable that part by removing the corresponding subfolder from the UI_bc1 folder. Check the feature list below to determine which module includes which feature to be disabled. Please note that EUI DLC will break if its Art* or Core folder are removed.
8.	in the game menu - options - interface options - UNcheck "single player score list" if you want to use the civilization ribbon and bundled notifications
9.	in the game menu - options - game options - set the desired delays (or no delay) for the map plot mouse over help / tooltips to appear using the big horizontal sliders (there are now 2 delays - basic and detailed plot help)
10.	in the game menu - options - game options - check if the "No Basic Tooltip Help" option matches the level of mouse over info desired (this has more effects than before)
11.	in the game menu - options - game options - check whether you want a clock displayed on the top panel
12.	silent install: althought this is a DLC, it will not appear in the game's DLC menu, because it does not have a Firaxis Key. This package is a DLC because I could not get things to work as I wanted as a mod (legal screens, map highlights), and it works in multiplayer and you can still earn achievements... The main drawback is that EUI's folder needs to be moved manually in/out of the game's DLC folder to enable/disable
13.	please report bugs or suggest improvements at http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?p=12847246

------------------
GAME COMPATIBILITY
------------------

Compatible ONLY with game version 1.0.3.144 or later
No effect on saved game load
No effect on game saves
Can still earn achievements
Works with Brave New World
Works in multiplayer (any number of players can have or not have)
Should work with Gods and Kings and Vanilla, but there may be a few odd kinks
Works on Windows, Linux, and MAC (there are install procedure differences)
Compatibility with tablet / touchscreen / windows 8/8.1: unknown, expect problems
Localization: EUI DLC relies almost entirely on Civ5 built-in text, using your selected language. Some of the unit & building tags have no built-in text, however, and would need to be translated. However, I don't know how to make DLC without Firaxis key manage new localized text, so this may never get done.

------------------
MODS COMPATIBILITY
------------------

Should work fine with mods which do not change game UI files.

Would actually be very convenient with mods that change gameplay, since mouse over tooltips now provide actual XML info as updated by mods (not harcoded blurbs).

EUI DLC is modular: in case of incompatibility, try disabling conflicting EUI DLC component by removing the corresponding subfolder from EUI DLC's UI_bc1 folder (please note that EUI DLC will break if its Art* or Core folder are removed).

Please check compatibility for some other mods at http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?p=12847246

If you have tested mods with EUI, please share your experience I will update the list when I get the time.

-------------------
IN CASE OF PROBLEMS
-------------------

1.	Please read the instructions carefully
2.	Make sure your game is up to date (EUI DLC is compatible ONLY with game version 1.0.3.144 or later)
3.	Make sure your EUI DLC version is up to date: download latest version from http://forums.civfanatics.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=21929
4.	Make sure any previous EUI DLC version has been deleted before installing a new version !
5.	Make sure the UI_bc1 folder has been installed in the correct game folder (see instructions)
6.	If you are using mods, try disabling mods to check for conflicts. Some early mods were folders starting with "z" that were put in the game's ...\assets\UI folder, those are not detected by the game's install or integrity check, you have to manually look for them.
7.	In case of conflicts, try disabling conflicting EUI DLC components by removing the corresponding subfolder from the UI_bc1 folder (please note that EUI DLC will break if its Art* or Core folder are removed)
8.	If problem persists, please report bugs at http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=512263

How to report a bug

1.	Report bugs at http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=512263
2.	What game version do you have?
3.	What expansions and DLC do you have?
4.	Do you play on PC or Mac? 
5.	Describe the problem 
6.	Attach a screenshot and/or a save game if you think it might help
7.	To attach a file to your post: click "go advanced", then click "manage attachments"
8.	If the problem is caused by a mod, what's the mod's name, version, and where did you get it (url)
9.	Post your lua.log error messages (or better yet, the entire lua.log), either as an attachment (compressed to zip or renamed to lua.txt) or within a spoiler markup
10.	The lua.log file is usually in ...\Documents\My Games\Sid Meier's Civilization 5\Logs. If it's missing or almost empty, you need to enable logging for debugging
11.	Non-trivial problem reports without lua.log will get no response

How to enable logging for debugging

1.	Close civilization V
2.	Open config.ini with a simple text editor such as notepad (usually in ...\Documents\My Games\Sid Meier's Civilization 5)
3.	Search for the line "LoggingEnabled = 0" and replace it with "LoggingEnabled = 1"
4.	Do the same with "EnableLuaDebugLibrary = 0": set it to 1. If this line does not exist, add it before LoggingEnabled
5.	Save config.ini and close 
6.	Start civilization V and reproduce the problem

1.	a vertical ribbon shows known civilizations and city states with mouse over tooltips, right click and left click actions
		- Civilizations are sorted by score. Their icon frame color shows the way they feel about you (friendly, neutral, guarded, denouncing, hostile). Small icons around the leader portrait indicate war, friendship (flower), open borders < >, research agreement, defense pact, and active player. To the right are their score and either total gold or gold per turn, depending on what you can trade with them. Icons shows available duplicate luxury resources they are willing to trade (theirs above & yours below), so you don't have to visit each leader to see if they have anything for trade (mouse over tooltips provides more details)

CityView: automatically open city screen when founding city (Duh! amazed at the time and effort required to make this work around "features" of game unit auto cycling. Still need to open manually when founding city on very 1st turn)
CityBanners: when allied, replace the city state banner icon with the flag of the ally
CityBanners: city state banner mouseover shows influence and resources available or granted

Bug: incompatible with the "single player score list" option (and "multiplayer player score list" as well) - fixed in 1.2
